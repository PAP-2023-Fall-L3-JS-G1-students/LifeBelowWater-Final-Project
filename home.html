                <p>Where we think this is important:</p>
                <p> Fishing: If we fish irresponsibly, we can kill many marine species, threatening our ecosystem and potentially leading to seafood shortages.</p>

                <p>Why we think this is important:</p>
                <p>Pollution: Debris in the water can cause marine life to either die or consume large quantities of microplastics, making them harmful to consume.</p>
                <p>Excess nutrients: Usually caused by humans, causes large algae blooms to overtake sections of the water and induce hypoxia, rapidly depleting the oxygen supply for sea animals.</p>

                <p>How we think this is important:</p>
                <p>The studies of marine mammals are joined with the studies of humans, such as the consumption of microplastics, or how a whales long breath underwater relates to its ‘cancer-resisting cells’. We can learn a lot from animals, and can even save humans by using this research.</p>
                <p>Medicine comes from the ocean. Pain killers, anti-bacterial and anti-tumor agents are all elements that are found from sea creatures and extracted for the development of medicines for us humans.</p>
