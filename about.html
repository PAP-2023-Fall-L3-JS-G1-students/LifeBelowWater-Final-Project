                    <p>"The goal of conserving and sustaining the ocean and marine resources for sustainable development is important to me because the ocean contributes to most of our oxygen supply, provides jobs, food and resources for billions of people, and species like coral protect coastlines from tsunamis, it is also where many marine animals raise their young. Marine animals like whales are also important for us humans since many studies conducted on human health are by studying the life and nature of whale."</p>

                    <p>“Ensuring conservation and sustainable usage of the ocean is important to me because the Earth is made up of 71% water. If we continue to allow destructive behavior towards our oceans to continue, one day we’ll reach a point where all our water is contaminated beyond repair, and everything on Earth, marine life, humans, and all other life, will no longer be able to exist, which is terrifying to think about. Also, I like eating sushi and I will be sad if salmon goes extinct."</p>
